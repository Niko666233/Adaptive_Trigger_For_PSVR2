# Battery Life Destroyer 9001: Energy Shortage!

For those who use PSVR2 but didn't know, you can use [PSVR2 Toolkit](https://github.com/BnuuySolutions/PSVR2Toolkit) to enable eye tracking and adaptive triggers etc on PC. There are already a couple of games (and mods) utilize those features so I think we should have this too.

## Features

- Clicky trigger effect
- Force feedback when firing, simulating recoil "kicks" (also vibration-based feedback as an alternative)

## Known Issues and Limitations

- You need to install [PSVR2 Toolkit](https://github.com/BnuuySolutions/PSVR2Toolkit) for this mod to function!
- My [![State-of-the-art Shitcode](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=State-of-the-art&message=Shitcode&color=7B5804)](https://github.com/trekhleb/state-of-the-art-shitcode) will make controllers' battery life drains considerably faster
- No per-weapon (type) configurations
- Can't remove left hand trigger effect (It's toolkit's bug so I can't fix this)

## I Asked Myself These Questions

### It's really useless and glitchy

- Sorry, I'm not good at modding. If you have any suggestions, feel free tell me. (Discord: 妮可_Niko666, I'm in UTC+8 timezone so probably won't respond to messages in time)

### I want more

- I'll do my best.🫡
